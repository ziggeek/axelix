# Caches

The **Caches** page provides access to all configured caches in the Spring Boot application. It displays cache 
metrics such as hits and misses rates, estimated entry size, allows status management, and supports clearing individual 
caches or all caches at once.

#### Clear All caches
We provide a convenient way to clear all caches in the application. To do so, click the <img src="/img/feature/icons/clear-all-caches-icon.png" alt="clear-all-caches-icon" width="80" height="20"/>

#### Clear cache
To clear an individual cache, click <img src="/img/feature/icons/clear-single-cache-icon.png" alt="clear-single-cache-icon" width="20" height="20"/> next to the desired cache.

#### Status
We provide the ability to manage the state of a specific cache. The initial state of each cache is (on) <img src="/img/feature/icons/switch-on-icon.png" alt="switch-on-icon" width="32" height="15"/>, 
meaning the cache is enabled. To disable it, switch the Status to (off) <img src="/img/feature/icons/switch-off-icon.png" alt="switch-off-icon" width="32" height="15"/>.
