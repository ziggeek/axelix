# Properties
The Properties page provides complete visibility into all configuration properties and their sources within 
Spring Boot application. It shows the current values, where each value came from and the priority hierarchy 
of property sources.

:::info
By default, the property value is hidden as `*****`. To enable value visibility,
you must add the property `management.endpoint.env.show-values` with the value `always`
to the Application properties files.

:::note Interactive Features
We provide the ability to change the property value:
1) To do this, click <img src="/img/feature/icons/overwrite-icon.png" alt="overwrite-icon" width="20" height="20"/> next to the selected property’s value.
2) After making changes, click the <img src="/img/feature/icons/cancel-icon.png" alt="cancel-icon" width="20" height="20"/> to cancel the change,
   or the <img src="/img/feature/icons/save-icon.png" alt="save-icon" width="20" height="20"/> to confirm the action.
3) After that, a pop-up message `Unexpected server error. Please, re-try request later.` will appear,
   and further interaction with the service will be unavailable until the Spring Boot application context is fully restarted.

:::warning
It is important to note that changing the value of any property triggers a restart of the Spring Boot application context,
which may lead to unpredictable consequences, **such as the application failing to start, degraded performance, or impacts on data integrity or security**.
