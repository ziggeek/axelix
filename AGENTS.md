## Overview 

This repository contains the source code of [Axelix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) project. Axelix is the software product that helps developers and Q/A engineers to debug/test/monitor Spring Boot Java/Kotlin applications.

### Architecture

The Axelix as a product consists of:

- **The UI/Front-end**. The source code of it is located under `front-end` directory. This is the React Application written in TypeScript, built using Vite.
- **Axelix Master** (or just **'master'**). The application that acts as the backend for the UI/Front-End. The Axelix Master is a Java 17 application. The source code of Axelix master is located inside the **master** directory.
- **Spring Boot Starter** (or just **'sbs'**) modules. Axelix Master communicates with the Java/Kotlin applications, that include Spring Boot Starter of various versions (like starter for Spring Boot 2, or starter for Spring Boot 3). The source code of all the starters is located inside the **sbs** directory.

### Building

As mentioned above, for Java code, the main build tool is Gradle. You can simply run:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

That is going to also run the linting checks, like spotless and pmd. You can select the module to build, or run the build on the entire monorepo if you see fit.

For the front-end, please, inspect the `front-end/packages.json` in order to understand the possible commands that can be run (for testing, linting and building the dist).

The backend modules are being built via Gradle build tool. The Axelix Project is a gradle multi-project project.

### Overall Behavioral Guidelines

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines, and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own changes.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless explicitly asked.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it unless explicitly asked.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
