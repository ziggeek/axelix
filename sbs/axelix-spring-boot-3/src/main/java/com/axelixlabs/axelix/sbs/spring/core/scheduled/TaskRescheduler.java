/**
 * Interface that is capable to "re-schedule" the {@link ManagedScheduledTask}. Understanding the
 * term "re-scheduling" here is very important, read extended javadoc for this.
 * <p>
 * The need for this abstraction emerges from the fact that {@link ScheduledFuture}, and
 * corresponding Spring's {@link ScheduledTask ScheduledTask handle} cannot be re-scheduled
 * in-place, that is to say that we cannot just {@link ScheduledTask#cancel()} or {@link ScheduledFuture#cancel(boolean)}
 * and then start the exactly same {@link ScheduledTask} or {@link ScheduledFuture} instance again.
 * That is just not possible by design.
 * <p>
 * Thus, in order to emulate the "re-scheduling" we have to follow the cancel-and-create pattern:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Cancel the current {@link ScheduledTask}</li>
 *     <li>Submit a new {@link ScheduledTask} that is copy of the old one</li>
 *     <li>Clean-up the possible state left about the old task in the spring context</li>
 * </ol>
 * So, the above combination is what is actually meant by "re-scheduling".
